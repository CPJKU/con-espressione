# Expressiveness backend

Mimicking real performances from sheet music with the computer constitutes a
challenging research problem. There exist a few systems which are either
rule-based---following common performance rules in classical music---or
driven by learned performance models.
This software provides a wrapper for such a data-driven performance model
(called the Non-linear Basis Mixer).

Through MIDI control change messages messages, the user is able to control
the global dynamics and tempo deviations for classical piano pieces
with hand movements.
In the background, the computer model adds subtle modifications to the
performance such as slight temporal differences in the note onsets
when playing chords.
As output, it creates MIDI events which can be played back via any software
based piano synthesizer or even via a player-piano as produced by Bösendorfer
or Yamaha.

## Setup

We recommend Anaconda to fullfill the Python requirements.
All needed packages can be installed through:

```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Ubuntu Linux Specific

The following dependencies must be installed before creating the conda
environment:

```
    sudo apt install pkg-config libjack-dev
```

## Run

```
    source activate expressiveness
    python expressiveness.py
```

## Playback

Expressiveness has two playback modes: MIDI rendering and Basis Mixer.
With MIDI rendering, you can load any piano MIDI file with Expressiveness and
control its tempo and dynamics.
However, the Basis Mixer requires a special file format which basically is a CSV
containing a list of note events (first three rows) plus a pre-computed
six-dimensional parameter vector which stores additional performance
information.

## MIDI Interface

The MIDI device name to connect to is `expressiveness-backend`.
